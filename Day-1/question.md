# Binary Tree Merge Problem  

## Problem Statement  
Given two binary trees, merge them into a single binary tree. The merge rules are:-  
- If nodes overlap, the value of the merged node is the sum of the two nodes.  
- If one node is null, the non-null node is used.  

## Constraints  
- `t1, t2 ≤ 100`  
- `A1[i], A2[i] ≤ 1000`
