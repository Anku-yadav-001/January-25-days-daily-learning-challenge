## Largest BST

## Problem Description
You are given the root node of a binary tree consisting of `N` nodes. Each node has some unique value. You need to find the size of the largest subtree that is a binary search tree (BST).

## Input Description
- The first line contains the binary tree in level order format.

## Output
Return the size of the largest subtree that is a binary search tree.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`
- `1≤ node value ≤ 10^9`

## Example 
### Input 
`10 2 4 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1`

### Output 
`3
