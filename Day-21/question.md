## Wildcard Matching

## Problem Description
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `?` and `*` where:

- `?` Matches any single character.
- `*` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

## Constraints
- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s contains only lowercase English letters.`
- `p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.`

## Example 
### Input 
`s = "aa", p = "*"`

### Output 
`true`
