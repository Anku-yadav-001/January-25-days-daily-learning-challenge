## Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## Problem Description
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

## Constraints
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Example 
### Input 
`[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`

### Output 
`[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]`
