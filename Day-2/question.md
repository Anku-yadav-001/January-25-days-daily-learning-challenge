# Depth of a Binary Tree

## Problem Description
Given a binary search tree, find its maximum depth.  
The maximum depth is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note**:  
- A leaf is a node with no children.  
- This is a function complete problem, so you only need to implement the logic to return the maximum depth.

## Input Description
This is a function complete problem. There's no need to take any input.  
The input provided below is just for understanding how a binary search tree is constructed.

- The first line contains the number of nodes in the tree (`t`).
- The next `t` lines contain the values of the nodes (`A[i]`), which are inserted into the binary search tree in the given order.

### Constraints:
- \( t \leq 100 \)  
- \( A[i] \leq 1000 \)

---

## Output Description
Return the maximum depth of the binary search tree.

## Example 
**Input Nodes** - [67, 99, 100, 36, 78, 21, 82, 98, 33, 45]
**Output** - 5
