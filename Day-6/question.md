## Rod Cutting

## Problem Description
Given a rod of length `n` and the price associated with each piece of the rod, determine the maximum revenue that can be obtained by cutting and selling the rod. The process of cutting should be done in such a way that the sum of the prices of the cut pieces is maximized.

## Input Description
- Number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50).
- For each test case:
    - Length of the rod `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
    - An array `length` of size `n` representing the possible lengths of the pieces.
    - An array `price` of size `n` representing the price of each piece of length `length[i]`.

## Output Format
For each test case, print the maximum revenue that can be generated by cutting the rod.
