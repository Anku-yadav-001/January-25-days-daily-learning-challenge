## Target Sum In BST

## Problem Description
You are given the root node of a balanced binary search tree consisting of `N` nodes. In a BST each node has some unique value. You are also given an integer `X`. You need to check whether two distinct nodes exist in BST such that the sum of their values is `X`.

## Input Description
- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- The first line of each test case contains the binary search tree in level order format.
- The second line contains an integer X denoting the target sum.

## Output
For each test case, the output will contain "Yes" (without quotes) if the target sum is present else "No" (without quotes).

## Constraints
- `1<= T <= 10`
- `1 <= N <= 10^5`
- `1 <= X, node value <= 10^9`

## Example 
### Input 
- `1`
- `4 2 5 1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1`
- `6`
### Output 
`Yes `
