## Everything related to Binary Search

## Problem Description
Given a sorted array with repeating integers. You need to find the first occurrence, last occurrence, and count of a given key in the array. USE ONLY BINARY SEARCH. Your algorithm should run in LogN 1  time. If the element is not present, print -1 -1 0. Â  


## Input Description
- First line contains N, then N integers in the next line, then key in the next line.

## Output
- 3 space-separated integers for the lower bound, upper bound, and count/frequency of that key.

## Constraints
- `N<=1000000`

## Example 
### Input 
- `6`
- `1 1 1 2 2 2`
- `1`
### Output 
`0 2 3`
