## Add two Linked Lists

## Problem Description
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. Â  

- You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
- Return the head of the updated linked list (in reverse order).

## Input Description
- First line contains the number of elements in the first linked list (t1).
- Next t1 lines contain a single node of the linked list in which the first element is the head.
- The next line contains the number of elements in the second linked list (t2).
- Next t2 lines contain a single node of the linked list in which the first element is the head.

## Output
- Print the linked list in reverse order, space-separated

## Constraints
- `1 <= t1, t2 <= 1000`
- `0 <= list[i] <= 1000`

## Example 
### Input 
- `3`
- `2`
- `4`
- `3`
- `3`
- `5`
- `6`
- `4`

### Output 
`7 0 8`
