## Problem Description
You are given n different numbers and an integer k. Write a program that finds the lower bound of k in log(n) time complexity.
Lower bound of a number k in a sorted list is the index of the first number which is the same as k, in case the number is not present, print -1 (here the answer is given considering the index to be starting from 0)   

**NOTE**: YOU MUST NOT USE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION.

WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION AND WANT YOU TO TRY THE LOGN SOLUTION.
USING BRUTE FORCE/LINEAR SEARCH, IN THIS CASE, WOULD LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION.

## Input Description
- First line contains N and K
- Second line contains N space-separated sorted integers

## Output
- Output lower bound

## Constraints
- `N<100`

## Example 
### Input 
- `5 2`
- `1 1 2 2 5`
### Output 
`2`
