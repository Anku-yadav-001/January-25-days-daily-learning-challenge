## 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬! (𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭)

## Problem Description
Given an array of n integers. Find its inversion count.
- Inversion Count for an array indicates - how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.

- If the array is already sorted then the inversion count is `0`. If the array is sorted in reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum.   

- Formally speaking, two elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` form an inversion if `a[i] > a[j]` and `i < j`.

## Input Description
- First line consists of integer n.
- Second line consists of n integers separated by spaces.

## Output
- Print count in a single line.

## Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 100000`

## Example 
### Input 
- `4`
- `8 4 2 1`

### Output 
`6`
